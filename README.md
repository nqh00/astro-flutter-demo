# astro_flutter_demo

## Overview
This Flutter project uses GetX for state management and dependency injection, and Dio for making HTTP requests.

The app will fetch data from the dummy API online and display a list to the device screen, which is [a list of astronauts](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json) currently in space.
